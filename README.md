# file-mover

## File-Mover is a command line tool that accepts three items, 1) directory path, 2) file extension to search, 3) folder name to create.
If all information is input correctly, the user identified file extensions will be moved to a new folder. 

## When specifying a file extension, please use '*.***'. 

## File-Mover includes a docstring which serves as a guide, should things go wrong. 

# Example: 

* /some/folder/path '*.py' 'New Folder'
